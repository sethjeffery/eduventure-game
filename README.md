## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed on your system
- OpenAI API key (for AI story generation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sethjeffery/eduventure-game.git
cd eduventure-game
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key by creating a `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Create .env.local file in the root directory
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Feature Flags
# Set to "true" to enable AI image generation for story steps (expensive!)
# Set to "false" or remove to disable image generation (recommended for cost control)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION=false
ENABLE_IMAGE_GENERATION=false
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## üîß Configuration

### OpenAI Setup

1. Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the environment variables shown above

### Image Generation (Optional)

The app supports AI-generated images for story steps using DALL-E 3, but this feature is **disabled by default** due to cost considerations:

- **Cost**: Each image costs approximately $0.04-0.08 via OpenAI API
- **Performance**: Images take 10-30 seconds to generate
- **Storage**: Images are served directly from OpenAI (temporary URLs)

To enable image generation:

1. Set both environment variables to `"true"` in your `.env.local` file
2. Deploy/restart your application
3. Images will automatically generate for story steps with sufficient content

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Choose Educational Subject**:

   - Select from Mathematics, Science, History, Geography, or English
   - Each subject provides context for educational questions during the adventure

2. **Select Difficulty Level**:

   - **Easy**: 7 story steps, simpler concepts
   - **Medium**: 10 story steps, moderate complexity
   - **Hard**: 15 story steps, advanced challenges

3. **Create Your Adventure**:

   - Enter a creative prompt (e.g., "A space station mystery")
   - Click "Generate Adventure"
   - Wait for AI to create your unique educational story

4. **Gameplay**:
   - Read the generated story content
   - Make choices to progress (mix of story and educational decisions)
   - Manage your health (hearts) - wrong answers cost hearts
   - Discover multiple endings based on your performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **Adventure Engine** (`useStreamingAdventure`): Manages game state, streaming, and logic
- **Story Renderer** (`StreamingStoryStep`): Displays rich text content with markdown and streaming
- **Choice System** (`ChoiceButton`): Interactive decision-making interface
- **Game Status** (`GameStatus`): Health, stats, and progress tracking
- **AI Generator** (`AdventureGenerator`): Multi-step setup and OpenAI-powered story creation

### Key Features

- **Streaming Content**: Real-time story generation with progressive loading
- **Educational Integration**: Subject-specific questions mixed with adventure choices
- **Smart Difficulty**: Adaptive story length and complexity based on selected level
- **Health System**: Strategic consequences for incorrect educational answers
- **Image Generation**: Optional AI-generated visuals for immersive storytelling

### Data Structure

Adventures use a dynamic streaming format with:

- **Steps**: Generated story segments with content and choices
- **Choices**: Player decisions with correctness indicators (`correct: true/false`)
- **Effects**: Automatic state changes (heart loss for wrong answers)
- **Context**: Educational subject and difficulty level integration

## üé® Customization

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS v4 with a custom gradient theme. Modify styles in component files or customize the gradient system in the UI components.

### Adding Educational Subjects

Add new subjects to `src/constants/index.ts`:

```typescript
export const EDUCATIONAL_SUBJECTS = [
  // existing subjects...
  {
    id: "new-subject",
    name: "New Subject",
    description: "Description of the subject",
  },
];
```

### Modifying Adventure Prompts

Update the adventure suggestions in `src/constants/subjects.ts`:

```typescript
export const ADVENTURE_PROMPTS = [
  // Add your custom adventure prompts here
  "Your custom adventure prompt",
];
```

## üìù AI Prompt Tips

For best results when generating adventures:

- Be specific about setting and theme
- Include character roles or objectives
- Mention desired complexity level
- Consider how educational elements can be naturally integrated

Example prompts:

- "A detective solving supernatural crimes in Victorian London"
- "A time traveler trying to prevent a historical disaster"
- "A cyberpunk hacker uncovering a corporate conspiracy"
- "An underwater explorer discovering an ancient civilization"
